Details
At Barilla, we're passionate about pasta. After all, we have been pasta makers since 1877. As an Italian family-owned food company, Barilla pasta is synonymous with high quality and "al dente" perfection every time. Our Penne is made from the finest durum wheat and is non-GMO verified, peanut-free and suitable for a vegan or vegetarian diet.
Penne means "pen" in Italian, and is a shape inspired by the quill of an old style ink pen.
The beautifully ridged shape of Penne can be served in a variety of ways: with meat- and vegetable-based sauces to olive oil- and dairy-based sauces, or bake it in your favorite pasta casserole.
