Our philosophy is simple. Stay true to what we do. And since 1983, we've been doing just that. Named for a small, off-beat coastal town of California, where it was founded by two artisan bakers, sourdough bread has quickly become a California favorite for those looking for authentic sourdough flavor & bubbling crusts. All of our unique breads are made through a slow baking process to give it that full sourdough flavor and texture. Baked with simple ingredients, no preservatives, and being non-GMO Project Verified, sourdough breads deliver great tasting, authentic California sourdough.
