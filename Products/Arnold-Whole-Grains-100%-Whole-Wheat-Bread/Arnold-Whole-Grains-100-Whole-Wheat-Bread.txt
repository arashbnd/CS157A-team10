Just because something is nutritious doesn't mean it shouldn't also be delicious. Oroweat Whole Grains Bread's recipes blend different grains, seeds, and/or nuts to deliver on both. Our 100% Whole Wheat Bread is bursting with flavor and nutrients in every freshly baked slice. Toast a slice and top with banana and a drizzle of honey for a quick and easy breakfast. Build a turkey and avocado club with fresh veggies for a restaurant-style sandwich at home. You can feel good about making simple and delicious choices with our bread whether you prefer it toasted or as a soft slice straight from the bag. It all started back in 1932, when Hermann and Betty Dreyer opened a small retail shop in Los Angeles that was half bakery, half grocery store-and full-on delightful. Back then, you couldn't find the premium bread that we love today. By starting small, the couple was able to give each brick-oven-baked loaf the attention it deserved. Today, though Hermann and Betty no longer make it themselves, Oroweat is still committed to bringing you bread you can believe in-so you can live your life and love your loaf.
